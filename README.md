# System-Proposal-Document
System Proposal Document for fictitious company
In any modern enterprise, it is crucial that all of the different stakeholders, users, inputs, and outputs that relate to the businessâ€™s IT systems coalesce in a logical and cohesive way for the systems to be effective. As a member of an IT team, the overarching goal is to ensure that the IT systems ultimately do what the business needs them to do. There are key principles and practices underlying the analysis, design, implementation, and management of IT systems. This final project applies this knowledge through creation of a systems proposal document.
